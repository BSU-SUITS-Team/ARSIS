# ARSIS-6
## The sixth iteration of of the ARSIS project.

# Project Summary

The Boise State NASA SUITS team is currently in the process of developing an augmented 
reality application, Augmented Reality Space Informatics System (ARSIS). The purpose of 
ARSIS is to help astronauts more easily complete EVA tasks.

Currently, real-life astronauts’ mission objectives are completed via written or 
memorized instructions. SUITS addresses this problem by creating an AR environment which 
will also communicate with ground control, and then be displayed in the astronaut’s helmet 
with up-to-date information and instructions about the task at hand. 

See last year's [ARSIS project](https://github.com/NASA-SUITS-Teams/ARSIS-6).
